# Zelsis Reddit Launch Kit & Community Playbook (v1.0.0)
## Senior Technical Growth & Community Outreach Guide

---

## Executive Overview & Strategic Intent

This playbook provides an end-to-end community distribution strategy for **Zelsis** across Reddit's engineering communities. 

Reddit developers are among the most technically rigorous, critical, and anti-marketing audiences on the internet. Successful community engagement requires:
1. **Zero Exaggeration:** No unverified metrics, no fear-mongering ("AI creates hidden vulnerabilities"), and zero marketing buzzwords.
2. **Value-First Architecture:** The post must provide standalone technical utility even if the reader never clicks through to the tool.
3. **Radical Transparency:** Clear disclosure of tool ownership, in-memory processing architecture, zero-retention privacy guarantees, and open limitations.
4. **Universal Utility:** Grounded in everyday web deployment challenges across Next.js, React, Node.js, Python, Docker, and full-stack web applications.

### 1.2 Community Rules & Anti-Ban Protocols

#### The 9:1 Community Ratio
Reddit moderators strictly enforce Reddit's global guideline on self-promotion: no more than 10% of your account submissions and comments should relate to your own product.
* **Account Preparation:** Ensure the posting account has at least 30 to 60 days of genuine history and a minimum of 100+ comment karma earned through authentic participation in developer discussions.
* **Avoid Fresh Accounts:** Submitting a showcase post from a newly registered account with 1 karma results in immediate AutoModerator filtering and domain blacklisting.

#### Trigger Words & Patterns That Alert Moderators
* **Banned Phrasing:** *"Revolutionary"*, *"Game-changer"*, *"AI-powered magic"*, *"Disrupting"*, *"Check out my launch"*, *"Join our waitlist"*, *"Limited spots available"*.
* **Banned Formatting:** URL shorteners (`bit.ly`, `tinyurl`), affiliate tracking parameters with explicit referral tags (use clean query parameters like `?ref=reddit_webdev`), and all-caps titles.
* **Gated Access:** Never link to a landing page where the user must input an email address or credit card before seeing the product work. The public GitHub repository scanner must be functional in one click.

## 2. Four Production-Ready Reddit Threads

---

### Post 1: Value-First Technical Breakdown for `r/webdev`

* **Target Subreddit:** `r/webdev`
* **Recommended Flair:** `Discussion` or `Resource / Tool` (Or `Showoff Saturday` if posted on Saturday)
* **Title:** `I built a free web-based release gate to audit repositories for security and config issues before deploying — looking for feedback`
* **Word Count:** ~620 words
* **Target Tone:** Pragmatic, humble, engineering-focused.

#### Raw Markdown Body:

```markdown
Hey r/webdev,

Over the past few years working across different production codebases (Next.js, Node.js, FastAPI, Docker), I noticed a recurring issue on our team: we had plenty of automated checks during development, but pre-deployment verification was still surprisingly fragile.

We ran ESLint for syntax and formatting. We ran `npm audit` for known CVEs. But right before merging to main or triggering a deployment, we kept catching things manually during pull request reviews:

1. **Client-side secret leaks:** Environment variables meant for backend services accidentally referenced with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` or bundled into client components.
2. **Missing Server Action authorization:** Assuming that defining `"use server"` on a mutation handler automatically protects it from public execution.
3. **Database connection exhaustion:** Serverless handlers instantiating unpooled database connections, causing connection pool exhaustion under sudden traffic spikes.
4. **Permissive CORS configurations:** `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` combined with `credentials: true` accidentally committed on an authentication route.
5. **Container root privilege escalation:** Production Dockerfiles omitting a non-root user directive (`USER node` or `USER nonroot`).

Linters don't typically check infrastructure and database patterns. Heavy enterprise security platforms (Snyk, SonarQube) are often expensive, slow in CI, and noisy with style warnings.

To address this gap, I spent the last few weekends building **Zelsis** (hosted at https://shipguard-saas.vercel.app). 

It is a lightweight, web-based release gate designed to perform a fast, unified pre-flight audit of any repository before you push to production.

### How it works technically:

* **In-Memory Analysis:** You provide a public repository URL. Zelsis clones the tree into memory, traverses the configuration files and ASTs, runs deterministic checks, and terminates the session. **No source code is ever stored on disk or used for machine learning.**
* **The 5-Pillar Scorecard:** Every scan evaluates 5 core areas:
  1. *Security Baseline:* Secret detection, CORS policies, injection patterns, unprotected mutation endpoints.
  2. *Configuration & Infrastructure:* Docker security, serverless timeouts, DB pooling, caching headers.
  3. *Dependency Hygiene:* Vulnerable or abandoned direct dependencies.
  4. *Code Hygiene & Error Boundaries:* Unhandled promise rejections, missing boundary components, empty states.
  5. *Web Standards & Accessibility:* Basic WCAG color contrast, form labels, viewport configuration.
* **Direct Remediations:** If an issue is flagged, the output includes an explanation of the risk and a suggested unified diff snippet to resolve it.

### Free to test without an account:

You can test any public repository on GitHub directly without signing up or entering a credit card:
https://shipguard-saas.vercel.app

### Questions for the community:

1. What is the one manual check you *always* run before deploying that automated CI pipelines tend to miss?
2. Are there specific framework-level patterns (e.g., SvelteKit, Remix, Nuxt, Django) you would like to see added to the rule engine?
3. Would a local CLI version (`npx zelsis audit`) be more useful for your day-to-day workflow than a web-based gate?

I would really appreciate any honest feedback, bug reports, or rule suggestions.
```

### Post 2: Founder Story & Utility Showcase for `r/SideProject`

* **Target Subreddit:** `r/SideProject`
* **Recommended Flair:** `Side Project`
* **Title:** `Show SideProject: Zelsis — a pre-deployment checklist for modern web apps with zero code storage`
* **Word Count:** ~540 words
* **Target Tone:** Authentic maker journey, transparent architecture, community-oriented.

#### Raw Markdown Body:

```markdown
Hi r/SideProject,

A few months ago, I was preparing to launch a side project on Product Hunt. Everything was tested locally and passing all unit tests. 

Ten minutes after launch, the app started returning 500 errors. 

The culprit? A classic serverless trap: I was instantiating a new database connection inside a Next.js serverless route without a connection pooler like PgBouncer. Under fifty concurrent visitors, the database reached its maximum connection limit and crashed. 

When I went back to fix it, I realized I also had a wildcard CORS rule enabled on an API route from early debugging that I had completely forgotten to remove.

Most indie developers and solo builders don't have dedicated DevOps or SecOps teams. We run `npm run build`, check that the console is green, and deploy. But build success only tells you the code compiles — not that it is safe or ready for real production traffic.

I decided to build the tool I needed: **Zelsis** (https://shipguard-saas.vercel.app).

### What Zelsis is:

Zelsis is an automated pre-deployment release gate. You give it your public repository, and within seconds it runs a comprehensive pre-flight checklist across:

* **Security Vulnerabilities:** Hardcoded API keys, exposed database credentials, insecure CORS, and unauthenticated server actions.
* **Deployment Misconfigurations:** Unpooled serverless DB connections, missing health checks, dangerous Docker permissions.
* **Dependency Health:** Direct dependency checks for known CVEs.
* **Code Reliability:** Missing error boundaries, unhandled async exceptions, and unoptimized assets.

### Architecture & Privacy First:

As a developer, I am very careful about third-party tools inspecting code. Here is how Zelsis operates:
* **Zero Code Retention:** Code is audited purely in-memory. Nothing is written to a permanent database, and we do not store repository contents.
* **Deterministic Rules:** No black-box guesses. Every flagged item points to a specific file and line number with an exact remediation diff.
* **No Account Required for Public Audits:** You do not need to register, provide an email, or enter payment info to test a public repository.

### Current Tech Stack:
* Frontend: Next.js 15 (App Router), Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Radix UI primitives
* Engine: In-memory AST and pattern evaluation engine
* Hosting: Vercel with edge-optimized middleware

### Where I need your input:

I would love for fellow builders here to run their side project repos through it and tell me where it falls short. 

Link: https://shipguard-saas.vercel.app

* Did it flag any false positives?
* What checks would give you the most confidence before you hit "Deploy"?

Thank you for your time and feedback!

### Post 3: Framework Hygiene Checklist for `r/nextjs`

* **Target Subreddit:** `r/nextjs`
* **Recommended Flair:** `Tips / Best Practices` or `Discussion`
* **Title:** `Checklist of common production gotchas in Next.js 14/15 and an open tool to test them`
* **Word Count:** ~680 words
* **Target Tone:** Deeply technical, practical, educational.

#### Raw Markdown Body:

```markdown
Hey everyone,

Next.js (especially versions 14 and 15 with App Router) has made building full-stack web applications incredibly fast. However, moving the backend boundary directly into the React component tree introduces subtle production gotchas that standard TypeScript compilers and linters do not catch.

Here is a compiled checklist of 6 common production issues we frequently encounter in Next.js codebases, along with practical solutions:

---

### 1. Accidental Secret Leaks via `NEXT_PUBLIC_`
**The Issue:** Prefixing an environment variable with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` bakes that value directly into the JavaScript client bundle sent to the browser.
**The Fix:** Audit your `.env.example` and server utilities. Ensure service-role keys (Supabase `SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, Stripe Secret Keys, AWS credentials) are strictly accessed server-side and never prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`.

### 2. Assuming `"use server"` Protects Server Actions
**The Issue:** Marking an asynchronous function with `"use server"` exports it as a public HTTP POST endpoint. Anyone with the generated action ID can trigger the function directly without passing through your UI.
**The Fix:** Always treat Server Actions like public API routes:
```typescript
// BAD: Unauthenticated mutation
export async function updateUserSettings(data: SettingsInput) {
  'use server';
  await db.settings.update(data);
}

// GOOD: Explicit session and authorization check
export async function updateUserSettings(data: SettingsInput) {
  'use server';
  const session = await auth();
  if (!session?.user?.id) throw new Error("Unauthorized");
  await db.settings.update({ where: { userId: session.user.id }, data });
}
```

### 3. Serverless DB Connection Starvation
**The Issue:** Running standard ORMs without a connection pooler inside serverless routes creates a fresh connection on every request invocation.
**The Fix:** Use a connection pooler (such as PgBouncer or Supabase Transaction Pooler on port 6543) and cache the client instance globally in development to prevent hot-reload connection leaks.

### 4. Running Production Docker Containers as `root`
**The Issue:** Default Next.js standalone Dockerfiles that omit user creation execute the Node process as root inside the container.
**The Fix:** Create a dedicated system group and user in your Dockerfile:
```dockerfile
RUN addgroup --system --gid 1001 nodejs
RUN adduser --system --uid 1001 nextjs
USER nextjs
```

### 5. Overly Permissive CORS on Route Handlers
**The Issue:** Returning `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` while accepting authentication cookies or authorization headers enables cross-origin credential misuse.
**The Fix:** Restrict the allowed origin explicitly to your verified application domain in your route handlers or middleware.

### 6. Missing Error Boundaries on Nested Dynamic Segments
**The Issue:** A failing database fetch in a child page without a localized `error.tsx` file crashes the entire route segment up to the nearest parent layout.
**The Fix:** Place granular `error.tsx` and `loading.tsx` files inside dynamic folder routes (`[id]/error.tsx`) to isolate runtime exceptions gracefully.

---

### We automated this checklist:

We built a free tool called **Zelsis** (https://shipguard-saas.vercel.app) to automate these checks. 

It audits your public Next.js repository against these specific patterns (along with OWASP security, container settings, and dependency CVEs) and outputs a pass/fail release gate scorecard with unified diff patches.

It runs purely in memory (we do not store your code or train models on it) and requires no account.

If you are deploying a Next.js project soon, feel free to run a check and let me know if we missed any framework-specific edge cases:
https://shipguard-saas.vercel.app

What other Next.js production gotchas have bitten you on launch day?

### Post 4: Pre-Launch Operational Advice for `r/SaaS`

* **Target Subreddit:** `r/SaaS`
* **Recommended Flair:** `Advice / Experience` or `Feedback`
* **Title:** `How we structured our pre-deployment checklist to avoid launch day fires (and the automated tool we built for it)`
* **Word Count:** ~610 words
* **Target Tone:** Experienced, peer-to-peer founder advisory, operational focus.

#### Raw Markdown Body:

```markdown
Hi r/SaaS,

Most SaaS launch guides focus on distribution: Product Hunt upvotes, cold outbound, Twitter build-in-public, and directory submissions.

Very few people discuss the operational nightmare of technical launch day fires:
* The payment webhook that fails silently because signature verification was untested.
* The database that locks up because connection limits weren't configured for a spike.
* The staging API key left in production environment variables.
* The missing cookie consent policy that causes compliance complaints in your first European signups.

When you are bootstrapping or working with a small team, you don't have an operations department. You are writing code, setting up Stripe, answering customer emails, and managing servers simultaneously. 

To keep our releases predictable, we formalized a 4-layer pre-deployment release gate. Here is the operational checklist we use before any public launch:

---

### Layer 1: Access & Authorization Integrity
* [ ] **Secret Hygiene:** Verify that third-party keys (Stripe, Resend, Supabase) are strictly scoped. Production keys should never exist in commit history or client bundles.
* [ ] **Server Action & API Security:** Verify that all data mutation endpoints validate session identity and user permissions, not just input schemas.
* [ ] **Webhook Idempotency:** Ensure webhooks (especially billing events like `checkout.session.completed`) handle duplicate event IDs without double-crediting accounts.

### Layer 2: Infrastructure Resilience
* [ ] **Connection Pooling:** Ensure relational databases are connected via connection poolers (PgBouncer, Prisma Accelerate, etc.) to handle concurrent connection bursts.
* [ ] **Container Privilege Hardening:** If self-hosting with Docker, verify the application process runs under an unprivileged user account.
* [ ] **Health Endpoint:** Verify a lightweight `/api/health` route is accessible for uptime monitoring.

### Layer 3: Error Boundaries & Observability
* [ ] **Graceful Degradation:** Verify that UI components have fallback states (`error.tsx` or React Error Boundaries) so one broken widget does not blank the screen.
* [ ] **Error Logging:** Verify a reporting tool (Sentry, Logflare, or structured logging) captures unhandled promise rejections.

### Layer 4: Privacy & Compliance Minimums
* [ ] **Data Retention & Privacy Notice:** Verify a visible Privacy Policy and Terms of Service are linked in the footer and registration flow.
* [ ] **Storage Hygiene:** Ensure temporary file uploads or uploaded assets have automatic lifecycle expiration rules.

---

### Automating the Checklist:

Going through this checklist manually on every release became tedious. To solve this, we built **Zelsis** (https://shipguard-saas.vercel.app).

It is a free pre-deployment release gate that automatically audits public repositories against these security, configuration, and reliability standards. 

It runs in-memory without storing source code, generates a 0-100 release readiness score, and provides the exact code diffs needed to fix any flagged items.

You can run any repository through it without signing up:
https://shipguard-saas.vercel.app

What manual checks do you consider non-negotiable before taking a new SaaS project public?

## 3. Comment Handling & Objection Playbook

Developers on Reddit will test your claims with sharp, specific questions. Below are exact, field-tested response scripts designed to communicate technical competence, complete honesty, and transparency.

---

### Objection 1: "Why not just use ESLint / npm audit?"

**Developer Skepticism:** *"This seems redundant. We already have ESLint in our editor and npm audit running in CI."*

**Recommended Response:**
```markdown
That is a completely fair point. ESLint and `npm audit` are essential, and we definitely recommend keeping both active in your pipeline.

The reason we built Zelsis is that they each focus on narrow, specific layers:
1. **ESLint** analyzes JavaScript/TypeScript ASTs for syntax errors, style conventions, and localized code patterns. It does not inspect full-stack infrastructure: it won't check if your Dockerfile runs as root, whether your serverless database connection is pooled, or if your CORS headers allow credentialed wildcards.
2. **`npm audit`** checks known CVE databases for vulnerable dependencies, but it doesn't analyze your actual business logic or framework-specific configurations (like an unauthenticated Next.js Server Action or an exposed client-side environment variable).

Zelsis acts as a unified release gate that brings together code hygiene, infrastructure configurations, and security baselines into a single pre-deployment scorecard. It is complementary to linters, not a replacement.
```

---

### Objection 2: "Is my code safe? Do you store my source code?"

**Developer Skepticism:** *"No way am I pasting my repository URL into a random web tool. What are you doing with my code?"*

**Recommended Response:**
```markdown
I 100% understand and respect that skepticism. Code privacy is the primary reason many developers avoid third-party scanners.

Here is our exact architecture:
1. **In-Memory Analysis:** When you trigger an audit for a public repository, the files are fetched into an ephemeral, isolated memory buffer.
2. **Zero Disk Storage:** Your source code is never written to a permanent database or disk storage. 
3. **Zero Model Training:** We do not train machine learning models on scanned code.
4. **Immediate Cleanup:** As soon as the static rules finish evaluation (usually within 3 to 5 seconds), the in-memory representation is purged, and only the summarized score and findings are returned to your browser session.

For teams with strict compliance policies or private repositories that cannot be audited via a web service, we are currently working on an open-source CLI version (`npx zelsis audit`) that runs entirely on your local machine without sending any data over the network.
```

---

### Objection 3: "How is this different from Snyk / SonarQube?"

**Developer Skepticism:** *"Isn't this just a worse version of Snyk or SonarQube?"*

**Recommended Response:**
```markdown
Snyk and SonarQube are fantastic enterprise platforms with deep analysis capabilities, and if you are at a large enterprise with a dedicated security budget, they make a lot of sense.

However, for solo developers, indie teams, and modern full-stack web startups, they come with significant friction:
1. **Cost & Gating:** Snyk can run up to $98 per developer per month, and many advanced features require custom enterprise quotes and sales calls.
2. **Speed & CI Overhead:** Running heavy enterprise SAST suites often adds 5 to 10 minutes to pull request checks, slowing down fast iteration cycles.
3. **Modern Stack Focus:** Legacy tools often focus heavily on Java/C# patterns or produce hundreds of noisy style warnings. Zelsis is calibrated specifically for modern web architectures (Next.js 14/15, React, Node.js, Python web, Docker, Supabase) and catches the exact misconfigurations common in modern cloud environments.
4. **Frictionless Pre-Flight:** You can run a check in 3 seconds directly from a browser before deploying, without having to configure complex YAML files or install heavy daemons.
```

---

### Objection 4: "Found a false positive on my repository"

**Developer Skepticism:** *"Your tool flagged an error on line 42 of my repo, but this is a false positive because I am handling authorization in middleware."*

**Recommended Response:**
```markdown
Thank you so much for pointing this out — you are completely right. If your authorization is enforced upstream at the middleware layer, flagging that specific endpoint as unauthenticated is a false positive in your architecture.

Static analysis without full runtime tracing can sometimes miss cross-file middleware context. 

Could you share the repository or the middleware pattern you are using? I would love to update our rule engine today to recognize that upstream guard and prevent that false positive for you and others. Really appreciate you taking the time to test it and call this out!
```

---

### Objection 5: "This is just a regex scanner / AI wrapper"

**Developer Skepticism:** *"Let me guess, this is just a couple of regexes or an LLM wrapper making stuff up."*

**Recommended Response:**
```markdown
I appreciate the bluntness — there are way too many low-effort LLM wrappers flooding the developer ecosystem right now.

To be clear: **Zelsis does not use generative LLMs to invent findings.** 

The engine uses deterministic static analysis: abstract syntax tree (AST) inspection combined with structured pattern matching across configuration manifests (Dockerfiles, package manifests, environment configurations, and routing files). 

Because the rules are deterministic, you get consistent results every time, zero hallucinations, and exact file/line references with reproducible remediations. We believe security and release gates must be predictable, not probabilistic.
```

### Phase-by-Phase Execution Checklist

#### Hour -1: Pre-Submission Verification
- [ ] Verify that https://shipguard-saas.vercel.app is healthy and running with zero downtime.
- [ ] Run a test audit on a sample public repository to ensure GitHub API rate limits have adequate headroom.
- [ ] Confirm mobile responsiveness on iOS and Android viewports.
- [ ] Ensure all direct URLs in the post body use clean parameters (e.g., `?ref=reddit_webdev`) without affiliate tags.

#### Hour 0 to 1: The Golden Hour (Highest Criticality)
- [ ] Submit the post during the optimal posting window (8:00 AM – 9:30 AM EST).
- [ ] **Do NOT upvote your post with alt accounts.** Reddit's anti-fraud algorithm detects vote manipulation across shared IPs and browser fingerprints, resulting in shadowbans.
- [ ] Stay logged in at your keyboard.
- [ ] Reply to every initial comment within 5 to 10 minutes.
- [ ] Maintain a warm, humble, developer-first tone. Say "thank you" for critical feedback.

#### Hour 1 to 4: Technical Deep Dives & Real-Time Fixes
- [ ] Engage in detailed architectural discussions on flagged topics.
- [ ] If someone reports a clear bug or false positive:
  1. Acknowledge it immediately in the comment.
  2. Implement the patch in your codebase.
  3. Deploy the fix to production.
  4. Reply back: *"Just pushed a patch to resolve this false positive. If you re-run your check, it should now pass cleanly. Thanks for catching that!"* (This generates immense community goodwill).

#### Hour 4 to 12: Managing Timezone Waves
- [ ] Monitor comments coming from European afternoon and US West Coast morning traffic.
- [ ] Track common feature requests and log them into your internal product backlog (e.g., local CLI, GitHub Action integration, custom rule config).

#### Hour 12 to 24: Community Recap & Post Update
- [ ] If the thread receives strong traction (50+ upvotes), add an **"Edit / Update"** block at the bottom of the original post:
```markdown
---
**Update:** Thanks so much for all the thoughtful feedback and tough questions today! Based on your suggestions, we have already:
1. Fixed the false positive reported with upstream middleware authentication.
2. Added the local CLI tool (`npx zelsis audit`) to our immediate sprint roadmap.
3. Expanded rule documentation for Next.js 15 standalone container builds.

Really appreciate this community's rigor.
```
